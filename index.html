    <!--  The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 
Here's how the app works: -->



    <!-- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. -->

    <!-- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.  -->


    <!-- Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, update the player's score counter. -->


    <!-- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number. -->

    <!-- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. -->


    <!-- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. -->


    <!-- The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game. -->
